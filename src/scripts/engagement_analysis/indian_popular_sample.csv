Best way of teaching \u2764\ufe0f""], ""@shasheen9684"": [""\""\""\""\""Electric flux is defined as the number of magnetic field lines.................so on.....\""\""\""\""\"" This is of course a definition given in most of unauthentic books. As per this electric flux is a number so it won't have dimensions so no unit but we see it has dimensions and thus a unit.\nIf two students have similar situations of two charges and two surfaces in order  to get same answer for flux they must draw same number of field lines but physics does not decide how many field  lines you want to draw.\nField  is something real and hence imaginary field lines will in no way help to synthesize an operational definition of electric flux.\nActually u can define it as\nElectric flux through a surface is defined as the surface integral of normal component of electric field calculated over the given surface.\nACTUALLY definition of DEFINITION OF A PHYSICAL QUANTITY is set of precise words which give an operational way to measure that physical quantity.\nSo resistance is defined as opposition to current is wrong as it is only a statement regrading resistance but not definition.\nResistance of a conductor is ratio of potential difference applied across the ends of the conductor to current flowing through it is the definition as it gives an operational way that will helo us to measure it.\nThat is why such simple but deceptive words for electric flux are not found in..\n1.Fundamentals Of Physics\nResnik Halliday Walker\n2.University Physics\nZemansky Freedman Young.\n3.PHYSICS by Alen Giambattista   R C Richardson.\n4.Hewitt\n5.NCERT texts  original copies.\nThese books are internationally reputed as bible physics.\nSimilarly one cant define Electric Field as the region/space around a charge in which other charge feels some force\u2026..bcz as per these words electric field has same unit as of region \u2026that is m^3 !!!\nI feel these authors have not tried to write the definition of terms like force mass charge etc where other books have these things as their vital content. In one of your lectures sir you told we need to make some changes like regarding concept of mass.\nHope it may b a good beginning. \nTheses difference are well seen after going through the wordings great authors \nWith regards.""], ""@35ishadnadaf73"": [""sir why didn't show u that NCERT problems there still we would cleared our concepts""], ""@saisatvika1218"": [""Sir apki vajah se mujhe day by day physics me bahut interest ho  rahi hai ...tq sir ......""], ""@arpandeepkaur5753"": [""sir u is the best teacher in physics I have ever seem.""], ""@bhavanisheshagiri2025"": [""Good evening sir\nAt 40.29 when electric field is normal to the surface then why don't we take an angle 180 degrees""], ""@abhishekkrgautam1815"": [""where is second part of this video please reply""], ""@rajudhandhi7206"": [""at 38.45, why area vector downward not upward""], ""@nishkarsh4400"": [""One of the best teacher \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f""], ""@niveditasharma9140"": [""Sir flux m apne sin kyu use nhi kiya""], ""@bhavyagoyal8787"": [""Kya yah Jee ke liye sufficient hai""], ""@ashokkumardhounchak2566"": [""How to find the direction of area vector""], ""@yashvarshney48"": [""Nice way of teaching \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f""], ""@internationalremixes6440"": [""how can we count lines of forces although they r imaginary???""], ""@nitishchouhan2194"": [""sir I have a problem that what area vector will be take ,area vector of upper face object or area vector of lower face object""], ""@DanishKhan-gw1dm"": [""sir Hamnaa yaaa electric field ma Angle Draw kar kaa yuki electric field less kyo kariii haaa""], ""@bilalyounas6414"": [""thanks a lot sir, respect and love from Pakistan""], ""@hifzurrahman4156"": [""sir Acos^ kaise aya?

The forces of nature are not all the forces in the macroscopic sense, they are just the fundamental bosonic particles in a modern quantum field theory description.\n\nThe normal force is due to the Pauli exclusion principle almost exclusively. This is because electrons have the property that two electrons cannot be in the same quantum state. Two electrons can't be at exactly the same point.\n\nBut you might be thinking, \""two point particles in three dimensions can't ever be at the same point, it's infinitely improbable!\"" In quantum mechanics, the particles are spread out in a wavefunction, and the condition that they can't be at the same point means that wherever their spread-out-ness overlaps, the wavefunction is zero. The wavefunction is in 6 dimensions for 2 particles, so it is hard to visualize, but the zeros appear on the diagonal part, where the two positions for the particle coincide.\n\nWhen you bring two objects to touch, the electron wavefunctions are squeezed together, and the average scale of variation increases slightly, because of the exclusion. The rate of change of the wavefunction is the momentum of the electron, and as you push them closer, it costs energy. This is the source of the normal force.
