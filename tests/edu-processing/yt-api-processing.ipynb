      "Comment: I attended MIT from September 1971 to May 1975, lived in A-Entry in MacGregor House, and double majored in Math and Management.  Prof. Strang was my professor for Linear Algebra.  I was already familiar with matrices and determinants from Intermediate Algebra and Modern Math in high school.  I can tell you that Prof. Strang was a phenomenal prof.  I always paid attention in his class and received an &quot;A.&quot;  My favorite topics were solving systems of linear equations, and finding eigenvectors and eigenvalues.  It&#39;s great to see that Prof. Strang is still going strong!\n",

Not only has he contributed and kept up to pace with the modern evolution of Linear Algebra and its applications (for instance in data science, Machine/Deep Learning). He has put so much thought and effort in developing good ways to teach Linear Algebra. To introduce, after such a distinguished career, the idea to start with A=CR is so awesome. It&#39;s a beatiful culmination of experience, thought, and dedication to teaching. What an impact. Thank you Professor Strang!\n",

I had the worst teacher imaginable and that was back in the late 1970s when you couldn’t turn to dozens and dozens of online resources like students have today. So if you got stuck with a bad teacher and a bad textbook you were doomed. God bless the Internet.\n",

I&#39;ve since been convinced that this is something even high school students should get taught (at least some of it).  Looking forward to viewing these!\n",

      "Comment: In Cuba, there was an Intro to Advanced Linear Algebra via Geometry which is better than what you are mentioning here in your video.  I never heard of matrix until I finish the Geometry part of Linear Algebra which took me a full real semester, not an American College semester which only last merely 4 months.  If I recall correctly, a REAL semester back in Cuba within the years 1976-78 when I was attending the university of Havana lasted about a bit more than 5 months or perhaps 5 months and 2 weeks.  It is a shame than in all my years studying Math in the US, and as an undergraduate student, I never took a class in Linear Algebra or Advanced Linear Algebra which should have included matrices and group theory just to mention a few important Algebra subjects which I did learn back in Cuba, but never here.\n",

      "Comment: Gil has responded to changes wrought by machine learning and several other commercial applications to completely change how he approaches the subject of linear algebra. It was actually astronomy and particle physics  that caused the interest in massive data sets long before Facebook or the current paradigms of machine learning etc even existed.  The amount of data coming out of the Hubble telescope and various other space related things and particle physics  gave rise to a need to efficiently search huge data sets for patterns. His latest book Linear Algebra and Learning from Data is all about implementing the new world view. I bought it to get into the groove again. When I was studying mathematics in the early 1970s, number theory was something of a backwater (or it looked to me that way then) but once the RSA algorithm was invented and computers and electronics became cheaper all that changed.  I think we are seeing a fundamental change in the perception of what is interesting and important in a commercial and intellectual sense and that is a drift from the continuous world to the discrete world. Interesting times.  Gil is one of my favourite US mathematicians along with the late, great Eli Stein from Princeton. Long may he ply his trade.\n",

      "Comment: There&#39;s already a book called &#39;Linear Algebra for Everybody&#39;, by a different author. The problem with two different books having the same title is that you can&#39;t google any one of them without the other one ending up in the search results. If you filter your search results by excluding sites that list one of the authors then your search results no longer list sites that contain both books. This makes it difficult to find the cheapest available price for the book you&#39;re looking for and academic books are generally very expensive.\n",

      "Comment: OMG!!! This is amazing! God bless you, Dr. Strang! By the way, could we have something like 18.06x course on edx platform? There are 18.01x (Calculus 1), 18.03x (Differential Equations) courses already. I would love to solve the homeworks for 18.06x (Linear Algebra) with edx experience. Thank you so much for it!\n",

If I recall correctly, a REAL semester back in Cuba within the years 1976-78 when I was attending the university of Havana lasted about a bit more than 5 months or perhaps 5 months and 2 weeks.  It is a shame than in all my years studying Math in the US, and as an undergraduate student, I never took a class in Linear Algebra or Advanced Linear Algebra which should have included matrices and group theory just to mention a few important Algebra subjects which I did learn back in Cuba, but never here.',\n",

       "  'comment': 'Gil has responded to changes wrought by machine learning and several other commercial applications to completely change how he approaches the subject of linear algebra. It was actually astronomy and particle physics  that caused the interest in massive data sets long before Facebook or the current paradigms of machine learning etc even existed.  The amount of data coming out of the Hubble telescope and various other space related things and particle physics  gave rise to a need to efficiently search huge data sets for patterns. His latest book Linear Algebra and Learning from Data is all about implementing the new world view. I bought it to get into the groove again. When I was studying mathematics in the early 1970s, number theory was something of a backwater (or it looked to me that way then) but once the RSA algorithm was invented and computers and electronics became cheaper all that changed.  I think we are seeing a fundamental change in the perception of what is interesting and important in a commercial and intellectual sense and that is a drift from the continuous world to the discrete world. Interesting times.  Gil is one of my favourite US mathematicians along with the late, great Eli Stein from Princeton. Long may he ply his trade.',\n",
